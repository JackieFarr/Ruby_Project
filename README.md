# Ruby_Project

Project - Web Programming with Ruby
Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

Object oriented programming with Ruby
Test Driven Development
Web Programming (REST, MVC)
Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)
Rules
The project must be built using only:

HTML / CSS
Ruby
Sinatra
PostgreSQL and the PG gem
It must NOT use:

Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.
